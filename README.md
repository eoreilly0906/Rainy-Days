# Welcome to Rainy Days!
For this project I wanted to make a website that would give the user a weather forecast for any city in the world.

## Link to project:
https://rainy-days.onrender.com/



## How It's Made:
Using Typescript to run the node project directly from the terminal! 
Made with VS Code it is hard coded for amazing interactivity!
Javascript is used to make the website interactive and fun!



**Tech used:**  JavaScript, Node, Typescript, Love and affection



## Lessons Learned:
Had a lot of fun with this project! I learned a lot about how to use the weather API and how to use it to make the website interactive. It was very challenging to get the history of the cities to work.
